        I am a high school student interested in computers, programming, and
        software development. I have learned a lot about programming since I
        started 5 years ago. I have learned JavaScript, HTML, Bash, C++, and
        am currently learning Go. I have learned to use importaint tools like
        node.js to host websites and even create encryption libraries.
