      <b>Who am I?</b>
      <small> &nbsp;
        I am a high school student in Eugene, Oregon interested in computers,
        programming, and software development. I have learned a lot about
        programming since I started 5 years ago. I have learned JavaScript,
        HTML, Bash, C++, and am currently learning Go. I have learned to use
        important tools like node.js to host websites and even created
        some RSA encryption projects. On most services my username is appins.
        <a href="http://github.com">Here</a> is a direct link to my GitHub.
        Some of my more notable projects are
        <a href="https://github.com/AppIns/calcPP">calcPP</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/AppIns/Elemental.js">Elemental.js</a>, and
        <a href="https://github.com/AppIns/jsCalc">jsCalc</a>. Please note that
        a large potion of my code has not been pushed for many reasons.
