          You can create an id that can be used to share to other people,
          easily share contact information, or just to have some easy way for
          other people to reach you. Once you create your id, you may do
          whatever you want with it. You can publish it online or share it with
          a very select group. Personally, I use it for when a classmate asks
          for a phone number or email address. It's much easier to give them
          a short link than a random number or long email address.
          You can also be sure they will have a way to reach you,
          either by email, phone, or even GitHub.

          If you need your id deleted for any reason, contact me through email.
          If your email address matches the one on the id, the process will be
          very quick to take down. If your email address doesn't match,
          it will take longer to take down the id.
